  <h1>Bye bye 2018</h1>

  <p>Well, This year is over. I canâ€™t say that was an easy year, I had a lot of changes in my life this 2018, I had to change my eating habits, I was rejected in two different tech congress, also I had to leave a community project that I started en 2016 to save my mental peace, and I lost my father this month. Although this year I have had to close many of cycles, also I have started many new things ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>

  <li>
    <p>I had the opportunity to be a mentor in two generations of MagmaHackers the MagmaLabs Program that helps to train graduate students to start their journey in the software engineering world.</p>
  </li>

    <p>I was able to attend as speaker and mentor to different local conferences and hackathons and I had the opportunity to meet a lot of amazing people from all the country.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I increased my open source contributions even I was able to send my first a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/">Solidus</a> project and this was accepted ðŸŽ‰.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had the opportunity to work in a super interesting project with amazing people from different countries, giving value and learning a lot of new things from my teammates. Especially thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/SanchezDav90">@SanchezDav90</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VzqzAc">VzqzAc</a> for all your support.</p>

</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m really grateful for everything accomplished throughout this 2018. Also thanks to all the people that help me in the hard moments, without your help none of this would be possible. I hope to have a lot of new challenge and happy moments in this new year 2019, I hope to have the opportunity to keep growing in my personal and professional life.</p>
